                    My name is Aboudou Ouro-Salim, and i am from Naugatuck, CT. Recently, I graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science, 
                    where I developed technical fluency and gained hands-on experience engineering software,
                    developing websites, installing hardware, and designing solutions for complex issues.
                    In addition to my academic experience, I have significant professional experience
                    maintaining networks and implementing solutions to guarantee performance 
                    of critical systems.<br>
                    I pride myself on being extremely focused, collaborative, data-driven, 
                    and goal-oriented in any project I approach. I enjoy partnering with 
                    cross-functional teams to conduct systems analysis, identify operational issues, 
                    and design effective solutions. My skills continually grow as I am presented with 
                    new opportunities to tackle new challenges. I have developed expertise in the areas 
                    of system maintenance, testing and troubleshooting, software engineering, 
                    hardware/network installation, and critical systems maintenance 
                    across the healthcare and I.T. industries.<br>
                    I am excited for the opportunity to leverage my academic experiences as I progress through
                    the next stages of my career. Connect with me if you are looking to network 
                    with an analytical, personable, and tenacious professional with a record of innovating
                    solutions to improve essential operational functions.
